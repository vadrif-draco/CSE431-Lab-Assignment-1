# CSE431-Lab-Assignment-1

### This repository contains the source code for the application

#### My currency converter application submission for Lab Assignment 1 has the main required features:
- Spinners to select currency types
- Text views for labels
- Button to trigger conversion (although I don't need it; check extra features below)
- Toast upon erroneous user behavior such as leaving the input field empty (selecting the same currency type for both input and output is not possible; check extra features below)

#### It has the following extra features:
- A button to switch currencies of input and output conversion
- A somewhat decent UI/UX, I hope? 
- Automatically populated spinners based on current selection

#### Here is a video of the application in action upon debugging it on my Android:
